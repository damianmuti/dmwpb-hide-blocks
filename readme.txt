[DMWPB] Hide Blocks.

== Description ==

This Wordpress plugin extends Gutenberg core blocks to allow Administrators to hide elements on the front-end under certain conditions, but keep them in the post edit screen.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/dmwpb-hide-block` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with any Wordpress installation? =

This plugin extends Wordpress core blocks, therefore requires Gutenberg up and running to work.

= What happens if I uninstall the plugin? =

The plugin uses server-side rendering for each of the blocks, so there won't be any issues upon deactivating it.

= Does this plugin work for all user roles?

No. Since managing content can sometimes be tricky, the plugin is restricted to Administrators only.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
