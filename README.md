# [DMWPB] Hide Blocks

This Wordpress plugin extends Gutenberg core blocks to allow Administrators to hide elements on the front-end but keep them in the post edit screen under certain conditions.

<br>

## F.A.Q

> Does this plugin work with any Wordpress installation?

This plugin extends Wordpress core blocks, therefore **requires Gutenberg** up and running to work.

<br>

> Does this plugin work for all user roles?

No. Since managing content can sometimes be tricky, the plugin is restricted to **Administrators only**.

<br>

> What happens if I uninstall the plugin?

The plugin uses server-side rendering for each of the hidden blocks, so there won't be any issues upon deactivating it.
